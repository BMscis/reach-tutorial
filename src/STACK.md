### ENGINE
======
  #### [NODEJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    Nodejs is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

### BUNDLER
======
  #### [ROLLUP] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup)
    Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It uses the standardized ES module format.

### PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
======
  #### [JAVASCRIPT] (https://www.javascript.com/)
    JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more.

### FRAMEWORK
======
  #### [SVELTE] (https://svelte.dev/)
    Svelte is a framework for building web applications just as React or VUE.
    We used svelte because with svelte we could develop components which functions as a html, has attributes,can be reused and are singularly responsive.

    ##### NFT COMPONENTS
      [NFT Component]: https://github.com/BMscis/reach-tutorial/blob/Nft-Algo/src/nftea-assets/assets/article/nftCard.gif "NFT Component"
      (https://github.com/BMscis/reach-tutorial/blob/Nft-Algo/src/Components/NftCard.svelte)
      With this design, we were able to define one component and reuse it for all possible nfts.
    
    In this sense, the application is a Single Page Application. Meaning the page is separated into components that reload individually and don't require a full page reload.

    SVELTE STORES
    Svelte also allows writables called stores that can be used to share data between components and can be used to trigger a signle component update when the store value changes.
    Watch as the wallet value changes once we connect to the wallet.
