A local step refers to an action taken by a single `Participant` outside the blockchain.

Each reach program is in a [local step](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/local/) after `initialization`.

Since we are building an NFT-auction, we need an NFT to be auctioned. 

As described in the beginning, we will need:

- Nft Id
- Nft price
- Auction duration

All this information will be provided by the `Auctioneer` `Participant`. To make sure that the `Auctioneer` is the only one who can provide this information, we will use a `Local Step` to do so.

`Reach` provides us with an [`only`](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/step/#ref-programs-only-step) method that we can use to do so.

```javascript
Auctioneer.only(() => {
    const {nftId, minBid, lenInBlocks} = declassify(interact.getSale());
});
```
Let's break it down:
- `Auctioneer.only(() => {...})` is a `Local Step` that only allows the `Auctioneer` to access the `getSale()` function we created above.

- `{nftId, minBid, lenInBlocks}` is the declassified `Object` that is returned from the `getSale()` function.

- The [declassify](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/local/#declassify) function makes the return value known.

- The [interact](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/local/#interact) function notifies the frontend and awaits for a response.

Now that we have the `nftId`, `minBid`, and `lenInBlocks`, we can publish this information onto the contract.

> Let's add this to [`index.rsh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BMscis/reach-tutorial/Documentation/Tutorial/Chapters/backend/4.AddingALocalStep/index.rsh).

```javascript
'reach 0.1';

export const main = Reach.App(() => {
    
    // Deployer of the contract.
    const Auctioneer = Participant('Auctioneer', {
        //getSale function.
        getSale: Fun([], Object({
            nftId: Token,
            minBid: UInt,
            lenInBlocks: UInt,
        })),
        //auctionReady function.
        auctionReady: Fun([], Null),

        //seeBid function.
        seeBid: Fun([Address, UInt], Null),

        //showOutcome function.
        showOutcome: Fun([Address, UInt], Null),
    });

    // Any subsequent bidder.
    const Bidder = API('Bidder', {
        // Add this function to the Bidder interface.
        bid: Fun([UInt], Tuple(UInt,Address, UInt)),
    });
    
    init();

    // Add declassify function.
    Auctioneer.only(() => {
        const {nftId, minBid, lenInBlocks} = declassify(interact.getSale());
    });
});
```
