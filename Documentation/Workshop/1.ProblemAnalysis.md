Problem Analysis
</h2>

Here's a summary of what we hope to achieve at the end of this workshop.
</summary>
<p>

The purpose of this workshop is to create an NFT auction and get bidders to race to get the highest bid with a limited amount of time.

Let's breakdown some concepts that we need to understand before we ask critical questions.

<ol>

<li>

<h4>

[Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

</h4>

A [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a distributed ledger that records transactions in a series of blocks. The series of blocks are linked together using [Merkel Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) where each block has a link to the previous block.
What makes blockchain unique is that they use [consensus](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/consensus-algorithms-in-blockchain/) which means each participant peer can confirm the validity of the blockchain.

</li>

<h4>

[BlockHeight](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/block-height.asp#:~:text=Block%20height%20refers%20to%20a,size%20or%20time%20in%20existence.)
</h4>

[BlockHeight](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/block-height.asp#:~:text=Block%20height%20refers%20to%20a,size%20or%20time%20in%20existence.) keeps count of all the number of blocks that have been mined since the beginning of the blockchain. Since each block can be mined at an approximate amount of time, the block height can be used to measure the auction time.

</li>

<li>
<h4>

[Auction](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+an+auction&oq=what+is+an+auction&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l9.5560j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
</h4>

An auction is a public sale where the item being auctioned by the `auctioneer` goes to the highest `bidder` after a certain amount of time limit.

</li>

<li>
<h4>

[Decentralized App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application)
</h4>

Decentralized applications are immutable, operate autonomously, and are not tied to a single entity. They run on the blockchain using consensus algorithms to force all participants to agree.
</li>

</ol>
</p>

<ol>
<li>

<h3>

[Objectives.]()
</h3>
Let's run through the objectives :

1. We need to create a Decentralized application and publish it to a blockchain.

2. The decentralized application should be able to conduct a successful auction in consensus.

3. The decentralized application should be able to autonomously moderate the auction and ensure fairness and honesty amongst all the participants.

</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>

<h3>

[Expected Output](#expected-output)
</h3>

We expect the decentralized application to : 

- Announce a winner at the end of the auction, 

- Transfer the NFT to the winner.

- Transfer the highest bid to the auctioneer.
</p>
</li>

<li>

<p>
<h3>

[Expected Input.]()
</h3>

We expect the decentralized application to handle : 

- A NFT to be sent to the decentralized app.

- A NFT price

- An auction duration.

- A NFT bid.
</p>    

</li>

<li>
<p>
<h3>

[Expected Processes for a Successful Auction.]()
</h3>

In order to achieve a successful auction, the decentralized app needs a few processes to be done : 

1. We need an auctioneer to create a new contract/DAPP.

2. We need an auctioneer to make the NFT being auctioned known to the contract.

3. Once the auctioneer sends the NFT to the contract, the auction is ready to start.

4. A bidder must  `OPT-IN` the contract/DAPP and accept the NFT token.

5. For a bidder to make a successful bid, the bid must be placed on time and the amount should be larger than the last bid.

6. The auction should continue until the timeout hits.

7. If timeout hits, the NFT should be sent to the highest bidder and the highest bid should be sent to auctioneer.

8. The decentralized app should exit and self-destruct if it has no NFT and the contract balance is 0.

<h3>

[Analyzing the Scope of the Problem.]()
</h3>

Based on what we have touched so far, we can now assess the possibilities and the limitations that will be encountered in the process of creating a successful auction. In order to get a clear understanding of the problem, let's break down our program into specifics by asking key questions :

1. What modules will we use to create and compile the program ?

2. Who will be involved in executing the contract ?

3. What tasks should be completed to make a successful auction ?

4. What data types will be used to hold program information ?

5. What functions can we use to help the actors participate ?

6. What algorithms can we use to run an honest auction ?
