Problem Analysis
</h2>

Here's a rundown of what we hope to accomplish by the end of this workshop.
</summary>
<p>

The goal of this workshop is to create an NFT auction and have bidders race to see who can make the highest bid in the shortest amount of time.

Before we ask critical questions, let's break down some concepts we need to understand.






<ol>
<li>
<h4>

What is an NFT?
</h4>

AN NFT is a non-fungible token. This means that each token is unique and not interchangeable with other tokens.
</li>

<li>
<h4>

What is an auction?
</h4>

An auction is a process of buying and selling goods or services by offering them
</li>

<li>

<h4>

[What is a blockchain application?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

</h4>

A blockchain application is a decentralized application that uses a blockchain as its back-end. The application is built on top of the blockchain and uses the blockchain to store data and process transactions.

</li>

<li>
<h4>

[BlockHeight](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/block-height.asp#:~:text=Block%20height%20refers%20to%20a,size%20or%20time%20in%20existence.)
</h4>

[BlockHeight](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/block-height.asp#:~:text=Block%20height%20refers%20to%20a,size%20or%20time%20in%20existence.) keeps count of all the number of blocks that have been mined since the beginning of the blockchain. Since each block can be mined at an approximate amount of time, the block height can be used to measure the auction time.

</li>

[Auction](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+an+auction&oq=what+is+an+auction&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l9.5560j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
</h4>

An auction is a public sale where the item being auctioned by the `auctioneer` goes to the highest `bidder` after a certain amount of time limit.

</li>

<li>
<h4>

[Decentralized App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application)
</h4>

Decentralized applications are immutable, operate autonomously, and are not tied to a single entity. They run on the blockchain using consensus algorithms to force all participants to agree.
</li>

</ol>
</p>

<ol>
<li>

<h3>

[Objectives.]()
</h3>
Let's run through the objectives :

1. We need to create a Decentralized application and publish it to a blockchain.

2. The decentralized application should be able to conduct a successful auction in consensus.

3. The decentralized application should be able to autonomously moderate the auction and ensure fairness and honesty amongst all the participants.

</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>

<h3>

[Expected Output](#expected-output)
</h3>

We expect the decentralized application to : 

- Announce a winner at the end of the auction, 

- Transfer the NFT to the winner.

- Transfer the highest bid to the auctioneer.
</p>
</li>

<li>

<p>
<h3>

[Expected Input.](#expected-input)
</h3>

We expect the decentralized application to handle: 

- AN NFT to be sent to the decentralized app.

- AN NFT price

- An auction duration.

- AN NFT bid.
</p>    

</li>

<li>
<p>
<h3>

[Expected Processes for a Successful Auction.]()
</h3>

In order to achieve a successful auction, the decentralized app needs a few processes to be done : 

1. We need an auctioneer to create a new contract/DAPP.

2. We need an auctioneer to make the NFT being auctioned known to the contract.

3. Once the auctioneer sends the NFT to the contract, the auction is ready to start.

4. A bidder must  `OPT-IN` the contract/DAPP and accept the NFT token.

5. For a bidder to make a successful bid, the bid must be placed on time and the amount should be larger than the last bid.

6. The auction should continue until the timeout hits.

7. If timeout hits, the NFT should be sent to the highest bidder and the highest bid should be sent to auctioneer.

8. The decentralized app should exit and self-destruct if it has no NFT and the contract balance is 0.

<h3>

[Analyzing the Scope of the Problem.]()
</h3>

Based on what we have touched so far, we can now assess the possibilities and the limitations that will be encountered in the process of creating a successful auction. In order to get a clear understanding of the problem, let's break down our program into specifics by asking key questions :

1. What modules will we use to create and compile the program ?

2. What data types will be used to hold program information ?

3. What functions can we use to help the actors participate ?

4. What tasks should be completed to make a successful auction?

5. Who will be involved in executing the contract ?

6. What algorithms can we use to run an honest auction?
