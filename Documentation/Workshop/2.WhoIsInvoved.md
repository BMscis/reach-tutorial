Let's start with a simple question:

## Who is involved in a successful auction?

In order to perform a successful auction, we need to have  :

1. An Auctioneer.

2. A Bidder.

> So we need at least two `participants` to conduct a successful auction. Luckily, **Reach** provides us with the `Participant` class that we can use to create our participants.

### Reach Participants

You can think of Reach [`participants`](https://docs.reach.sh/model/#term_participant) as actors in a contract. Here we'll need two actors :

1. A `deployer` of the contract. (`Auctioneer`)

2. A `player` or any other actor that agrees to the contract wager. (`Bidder`)
