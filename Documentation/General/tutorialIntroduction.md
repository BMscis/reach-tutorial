In this tutorial, we will be creating a simple smart contract that will allow us to mint a new NFT. We will be using the reach programming language to write our smart contract.

To get started with the reach programming language. You can find instructions on how to do this here:

[Reach Quick Start](https://docs.nftworkshop.com/en/latest/getting-started.html).

You can also find a working example here:

Once you have installed the  reach programming language, you will need to create a new project. To do this, open the terminal and type the following command:

```bash
./reach init
```

Alternatively, you can create :

- an `index.rsh` file.
- an `index.mjs file.

Assuming they are in the same directory as the reach executable.
