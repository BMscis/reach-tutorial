## Requirements.

- You will need [Reach Programming language](https://docs.nftworkshop.com/en/latest/getting-started.html) installed on your computer. We are going to use Reach for our backend contract.

- One of the advantages of Reach is that it can support multiple blockchains and can be compiled to [different programming languages](https://docs.reach.sh/guide/rpc/#guide-rpc). For simplicity we will use [Reach in JavaScript](https://docs.reach.sh/frontend/#ref-frontends). This means we will need [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
