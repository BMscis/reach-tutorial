<h3>

Problem Analysis
</h3>

Now that we have a basic understanding of the concepts we need to know, we can start to ask some critical questions.
</summary>
<p>

As a programmer we need to understand the problem that we are trying to solve. Here's a run through of the questions that pop up in my head.

1. What is the purpose of the auction?

> Our purpose is to create a DApp that autonomously runs a safe and secure auction that allows users to buy and sell items.

2. What is the value of the NFT being auctioned?

> The value of the NFT is determined by the owner of the NFT.

3. What is the minimum bid?

> For simplicity, we can use the asset price as the minimum bid.

4. What is the duration of the auction?

> The duration of the auction can be fixed or can be determined by the deployer of the DApp.

5. How will the auction be conducted?

> The auction will be conducted by the DApp itself.

6. What is the NFT being auctioned?

> Again, for simplicity, we will limit the auctioned NFT's to images.

7. How many bidders are there?

> Ideally, we would love to have as many bidders as possible.

10. When is the auction over?

> The auction will be over when the auction duration has elapsed.

11. How will the auction be secured?

> The auction will be secured using Reach programming language.
</p>

These questions are pertinent to the development of an internal conversation. However, 
because we are developing a DApp, we can reframe the problem by limiting the questions 
to defining the data that we expect the DApp to handle:

<details>
<summary>
<h4>

Performing Data Analysis.
</h4>

Turning the information, we know to data.
</summary>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>

What information does the DApp need to track?
</h5>

- The NFT being auctioned.

- The NFT price.

- The NFT amount.

- The auction duration.

- The NFT owner.

- The last bid.

- The latest bid.

- Bidder Address.
</li>
<li>
<h5>

What information does the DApp need to display?
</h5>

Each participant in the auction will require the following information:

 - The NFT being auctioned.

 - The NFT price.

 - The NFT amount.

 - The auction duration.

 However, depending on the role of the participant, the auction may limit how much information each participant has access to.

 If the participant is an auctioneer, for example, they can access functions that only they have access to. Such as:

  - Adding a NFT to the contract.

  - Deciding when the auction will start.


  The bidder, on the other hand, does not need to know much. In fact, once a bidder joins the DApp, all they need to see is the highest bid price.
</li>
<li>
<h5>

How should the app handle user input?
</h5>

The DApp needs to differentiate private data and public data. Private data should only be accessible to a local computer while public data can be displayed
on the blockchain.
</li>

</ol>
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<h4>

Functional Requirements.
</h4>

In this section, we look at the functions provided by the Reach language that we can use to run the auction.
</summary>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>

How can we create a new DApp in Reach.
</h5>

We'll have to take a look at the Reach syntax to conform to the methods available to us?
</li>
<li>
<h5>

How will we send the NFT to the contract?
</h5>

To ensure that the DApp is truly decentralized, we'll need the deployer to forfeit ownership of the NFT until the 
auction is over.
</li>
<li>
<h5>

How can we publish the NFT being auctioned to the blockchain.
</h5>

We'll have to make the NFT information public to all participants.
</li>
<li>
<h5>

How can we allow a bidder to OPT-IN to the DApp.
</h5>

There has to be a frontend mechanism that allows the bidder to opt-in to the DApp
and place a bid.
</li>
<li>
<h5>

How will we perform transfers?
</h5>

Once the auction is done, we'll need to transfer the highest bid to the Auctioneer and the NFT to the winner.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<h4>

Consensus Mechanisms.
</h4>

We'll also need to look at what Reach offers when it comes to consensus.
</summary>
<p>

Reaching consensus means that all parties involved in a decision-making process agree on a course of action. This can be difficult to achieve, especially when there are multiple stakeholders with different interests and goals. However, consensus can be reached through careful deliberation and compromise.

Announcing a winner at the end of the auction.
</h5>

- We will need the participant to learn new information in order to announce a winner:

    1. The winning bid.

    2. The Winner.


- How do we represent these two pieces of data in a DAPP?

    1. The winning bid can be represented by a [UInt type](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/compute/#rsh_UInt).

    2.  The winner can be represented by a [Address type](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/compute/#rsh_Address).

    3. The auction duration.


- How can we represent this information in a DAPP ?

    1. To represent the NFT ID, we can use a [Token type](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/compute/#rsh_Token).

    2. Because the price is a number, we can represent it with a [UInt type](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/compute/#rsh_UInt).

    3. We can represent the auction duration with a [UInt type](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/compute/#rsh_UInt), which will represent block height rather than actual time.

- We will need the participant to learn new information in order to announce a winner:

    1. The winning bid.

    2. The Winner.


- We've already established how to represent data; now let's look at how to send this information to the frontend.

```javascript

//showOutcone function.
showOutcome: Fun([Address, UInt], Null),

```

`showOutcome` is a function that does not expect a return value and sends the `[Address, UInt]` which are the '[winner, winning bid]' to the frontend.
</li>

<li>
<h5>

[Transferring the NFT to the winner.](#transfer-nft)
</h5>

- We will need to transfer the NFT from the contract to the winner once the auction is completed.

- Reach provides a [Transfer function](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/compute/#rsh_transfer), which is a consensus step that instructs the contract to send a token to the specified address.

```javascript

transfer(`UInt`,`Token`).to(`Address`);
```

When a condition is met, `transfer` takes a `amount` (`UInt`), a `Token`, and transfers the amount to an `Address`.

<h5>

[Receiving the NFT to be auctioned from the frontend.](#get-sale)
</h5>

Because it is the auctioneers' responsibility to include the NFT in the contract, we will ensure that only the Auctioneer is capable of setting the NFT.

We can use an 'interact' function to obtain information from the frontend whenever a participant backend requires it.

Here is the information we will require from the auctioneer:

1. The NFT ID.

2. The NFT price / starting bid.

3. The auction duration.


- We've already determined how to represent the data; now let's look at how to get this information from the frontend.

```javascript
//getSale function
    getSale: Fun([],[Token, UInt, UInt]),
```

`getSale` function expects the [Token, UInt, UInt]/([nftId, price, auctionTime]) from the frontend.

Reach also includes an [Object](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/compute/#rsh_Object) type for nesting other types.

```javascript
Object({
    nftId: Token,
    minBid: UInt,
    lenInBlocks: UInt,
})
```

Let's add this to the function:

```javascript
getSale: Fun([], Object({
    nftId: Token,
    minBid: UInt,
    lenInBlocks: UInt,
}))
```
</li>

<li>
<h5>

[Allowing a bidder to place a bid.](#place-bid)
</h5>

- Bidders must also place a bid, i.e., call a bid function from the frontend.

```javascript

bid: Fun([UInt], Null),

```

`bid` expects a number from the frontend which a Bidder address will be attached to during the auction.
</li>

<li>
<h5>

[Alerting when the auction is ready.](#auction-ready)
</h5>

- When the auction is ready to begin, we can also notify the Auctioneer.

```javascript

auctionReady: Fun([], Null),

```

`auctionReady` notifies the Auctioneer frontend when the auction is ready.

[Looking at Consensus Mechanisms.](#consensus-mechanisms)

##
</h4>

Introduction to [Reach Steps](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/step/)
</summary>

In this section, we will introduce new concepts that will help you understand how Reach works.

Reach can be in two states:
- Local step
- Consensus step

The majority of DAPPs include a creator, an actor, a wager, and a condition. Before a contract becomes autonomous, the creator publishes the wager and condition criteria. Once the creator has done this, they have no control over the outcome and cannot pause the contract once it has begun. The bidder can view the contract on the blockchain and decide whether to participate.

Local steps are performed locally by a single actor, whereas consensus steps are performed on the blockchain in consensus.
Local steps exist to ensure that each actor is unaware of what any other actor is up to in order to improve anonymity and security. 

If they choose to make the information public, they must go through a consensus step and publish it on the blockchain.
Consensus steps also ensure that the contract's core logic and conditions are run on the blockchain, where all active actors can see what is happening.

Let's go over the tasks that we'll need to complete in order to have a successful auction:
<ol>

<li>
<details>
<summary>
<h5>

[Adding Actors]()

##
</h5>

We've already decided [how we'll represent our data](#data-types), and we've established [functions that can be used](#functions) to get the necessary data; the last step is to incorporate the functions into classes that can perform logic and store states. They are referred to as [Participants](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/appinit/#rsh_Participant) in Reach.
</summary>
<p>
<ol>

<li>
<h5>

[Adding an Auctioneer Participant]()
</h5>

- We saw how to collect data using input and output functions in the [functions](#functions) section; now let's add the necessary data to our auctioneer participant.

```javascript
const Auctioneer = Participant('Auctioneer', {
    //getSale function.
    getSale: Fun([], Object({
        nftId: Token,
        minBid: UInt,
        lenInBlocks: UInt,
    })),
    //auctionReady function.
    auctionReady: Fun([], Null),

    //seeBid function.
    seeBid: Fun([Address, UInt], Null),

    //showOutcome function.
    showOutcome: Fun([Address, UInt], Null),
});
```
- Here, we create an Auctioneer participant with the name 'Auctioneer' and the auction data.

- We used the [`getSale`](#get-sale) function to get the NFT data from the frontend.

- We used the [`auctionReady`](#auction-ready) function to notify the Auctioneer when the auction is ready.

- We used the [`seeBid`](#see-bid) function to notify the Auctioneer when a bidder has placed a bid.

- We used the [`showOutcome`](#show-outcome) function to notify the Auctioneer when the auction is over and who the winner is.

</li>

<li>
<h5>

[Adding a Bidder Participant.]()
</h5>

- A participant class will also be used for the bidder. However, unlike the Auctioneer, who is a single actor, we anticipate that multiple bidders will be added to the contract.

- Reach provides a way of representing multiple participants with the [Reach API](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/appinit/#rsh_API) class.

- Consider the API to be a representation of multiple participants racing toward a common goal.

- In our case, we anticipate that Bidders will be able to [place a bid](#place-bid).

```javascript
const Bidder = API('Bidder', {
    //Bidder interface.
    bid: Fun([UInt], Tuple(UInt,Address, UInt)),
});
```
- A Bidder interface is available for representing multiple bidders.

- Each bidder will have a [bid](#place-bid) function through which they can place a bid.

> One benefit of the Reach API is that functions can be called from the frontend.

[Initializing the contract.](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/appinit/#init)

##
</h5>

What happens after the actors/participants are created.
</summary>
<p>

So far we've only discussed the API and the Participant. However, there are
other [Reach interfaces](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/appinit/#ref-programs-appinit-exprs) that we have not covered include [Views](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/appinit/#ref-programs-appinit-view) and [Events](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/appinit/#rsh_Events).

These interfaces represent which functions and classes the frontend should replicate and should be placed before the 'init()' statement.

```javascript

const newParticipant = Participant(participantName, participantInteractInterface)

const newAPI = API(APIName, APIInteractInterface)

const newView = View(ViewName, ViewInteractInterface)

const newEvent = Events(EventName, EventInteractInterface)

init()

// Consensus step or local step.
```
`init()` symbolizes the beginning of the DApp to be compiled. In other words, anything that follows the `init` statement is either a local step or a consensus step.

<h5>


[Using Local Steps.](https://docs.reach.sh/model/#term_local%20step)

##
</h5>

What follows the 'init()' statement.
</summary>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
<h5>

[Local Private](https://docs.reach.sh/model/#p_33) Step.
</h5>
When the 'init()' statement is executed, the DApp enters a [local private](https://docs.reach.sh/model/#p_33) step.
This means that any information accessed is only available on the participant's local machine.
</li>
<li>
<h5>

[Local Public](https://docs.reach.sh/model/#p_33) Step.
</h5>
Local private is not very useful if we have information that we need other actors to access, such as NFT data.
So, how do we make the transition from local private to local public?

- To accomplish this, we use [Reach declassify](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/local/#rsh_declassify).

> [Reach declassify](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/local/#rsh_declassify) allows you to send data from the frontend to the backend. To get the NFT information from the frontend, let's test this with the 'Auctioneer' participants' ['getSale'](#get-sale) function.

```javascript
//declassify function.
Auctioneer.only(() => {
    const {nftId, minBid, lenInBlocks} = declassify(interact.getSale());
});
```
- `Auctioneer.[only]()` function makes sure that only the `Auctioneer` i.e., the creator of the contract, can access this function.

- `interact` is a function used to get information from the frontend.

- `declassify` makes the information public.

> Here, we are interacting with the `Auctioneer` frontend and `await`ing the result (const {nftId, minBid, lenInBlocks}).

The information is public but it's still local. Let's move to a consensus step to publicize the information on the contract.

</ul>

<h5>


[Using Consensus Steps.](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/consensus/#ref-programs-consensus)

##
</h5>

Publishing information onto the contract.
</summary>
<p>

Reach provides a few mechanisms that can assist us in moving from a local step to a consensus step.

<ol>
<li>
<h5>

[Publish](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/consensus/)
</h5>

We can use [Reach Publish](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/consensus/) to share NFT information with the contract during the consensus step.

```javascript
Auctioneer.publish(nftId, minBid, lenInBlocks);
```
- `Auctioneer.publish()` function makes sure that only the `Auctioneer` i.e., the creator of the contract, can publish this information 
onto the contract.
</li>

## 
> Using [Commit()](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/consensus/#rsh_commit)

Once in a consensus step, we can use [Commit()] to return to a local step (https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/consensus/#rsh_commit).

How does this help the integrity of the DApp?
- Security reasons

We use commit to ensure that we are back in a 'local private' state before performing sensitive functions like contract payments.

```javascript

commit();

```

<li>
<h5>

[Pay](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/step/#rsh_pay)
</h5>

We can now transfer the NFT from the Auctioneer to the contract because we are back in a 'local private' step.

```javascript
Auctioneer.pay([[1, nftId]])
```
- The `Auctioneer.pay()` function ensures that only the `Auctioneer`, i.e., the contract's creator, can pay.
- We are submitting one NFT Token for auction to the contract.
</li>

> Because a NFT should be unique, we send [1] NFT. Rather than sending the 'UInt 1' directly, we can store the information in a variable.

```javascript
const amt = 1;
```

Then, Pay becomes :
```javascript
Auctioneer.pay([[amt, nftId]])
```

The DApp now has the information it needs to conduct an auction. The auction logic is all that remains. But first, let us inform the Auctioneer that the [auction is ready](#auction-ready).

```javascript
Auctioneer.interact.auctionReady();
```

When it comes to consensus transfer, or when multiple actors come together to agree on a single state, we can determine which consensus approach to use by asking ourselves a few [questions](https://docs.reach.sh/guide/ctransfers/#p_10):

1. How many participants can act at a particular time?

2. How many things can be done?

3. How many times can it be done?

##

We could use [Pay](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/step/#publish—-pay—-when—and—timeout) to transfer tokens to the contract if there was only one participant. However, because multiple bidders are expected to compete, we can use a [Reach Race](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/step/#rsh_race).
A reach race allows multiple actors to compete for the publication of a consensus step. 

However, there is a problem with this solution; the race function only runs once, and we need to allow bidders to place as many bids as they want as long as two conditions are met:

- The bid is placed before timeout.

- The bid placed is larger than the last bid placed.

##

We need to put the race in a while loop that allows us to do this. A while loop that runs until timeout is reached.

Alternatively, [Reach Parallel Reduce](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/consensus/#rsh_parallelReduce) can be used. In a parallel, actors are racing against the clock to publish data onto the contract.
Parallel reduce uses a while loop that resolves the auction to a single outcome or winner.

Parallel reduce is a recursive algorithm that generates a single winner from a tree of bidders.

```javascript
   const [winner] = parallelReduce([Auctioneer])
```

> The Auctioneer is the default winner before any bids are placed.

However, this is not a complete solution; for a closer look at the format, see [Reach Parallel Reduce](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/consensus/#rsh_parallelReduce).
For now we're going to look at how we can use parallel reduce for the auction.

<ul>
<li>
<h5>

[The Invariant](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/consensus/#rsh_parallelReduce.invariant)
</h5>

```javascript
.invatiant(balance() == 0)
```
After each iteration, the invariant is checked to ensure that the parallel reduce is still valid. We're checking to see if the balance is zero.

<li>
<h5>

[The While loop](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/consensus/#rsh_while)
</h5>

```javascript
.while(lastConsensusTime() < timeOut)
```
The while loop is active as long as the [lastConsensusTime](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/compute/#rsh_lastConsensusTime) is less than the time out value.
> The time of the last consensus step is represented by the lastConsensusTime (The last time a pay,publish or transfer was used).
