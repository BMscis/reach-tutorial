Welcome to my NFT auction workshop! This workshop will teach you the basics of programming an NFT auction using the reach programming language. Reach is a powerful and easy to use programming language that is perfect for creating NFT auctions. This workshop will cover the following topics:

1. Common Terminologies.

1. Define the use case and requirements for the DApp.

2. Choose a suitable blockchain platform on which to build the DApp.

3. Develop the DApp using the chosen blockchain platformâ€™s programming language and tools.

4. Test the DApp to ensure it works as intended.

5. Deploy the DApp on the chosen blockchain platform.

6. Promote the DApp to users and encourage them to use it.

I hope you enjoy this workshop!

In this workshop, we will introduce the NFT auction workshop and the reach programming language.
> The purpose of the workshop is to walk you through the thought process that went into developing the DApp. If you are looking for a step-by-step approach, please refer to the [NFT Auction Tutorial](https://github.com/BMscis/reach-tutorial/blob/workshop/Documentation/Tutorial/Full/full.md).

Here are some of the key concepts that will appear throughout the workshop:

## [What is Reach Programming Language](https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/)

The reach programming language is a language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the blockchain. It is a statically typed, functional programming language that can be used on multiple blockchains with a focus on safety and security. 

## [What is an auction?]()

An auction is a process of buying and selling goods or services by offering them up for bid, taking bids, and then selling the item to the highest bidder.

## [What is an NFT?]()
AN NFT is a non-fungible token. This means that each NFT is unique and not interchangeable with any other NFT.

## [What is a DApp?]()

 A DApp is a type of decentralized application that is governed by a set of rules encoded on the blockchain.

## [What is a smart contract?]()

A smart contract is a computer program that runs on the blockchain and automatically executes transactions when certain conditions are met.

## [What is a token?]()

A token is a digital asset that is used to represent a stake in a decentralized application. Tokens can be used to purchase goods and services, or to participate in governance.

## [What is a blockchain?]()

A blockchain is a distributed database that is used to store data in a secure and tamper-proof way. Blockchains are used to power decentralized applications.
