## Selecting a Blockchain Platform

Reach is a programming language that supports multiple blockchains, including Algorand, Ethereum, and Conflux. This allows developers to create applications that can interact with multiple blockchain networks. This makes Reach a powerful tool for building cross-chain applications.

What this means is that we can write just one contract and let Reach deal with the complexities of deploying it to multiple blockchains.

You can learn more about that here:
