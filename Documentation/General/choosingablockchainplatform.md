## Selecting a Blockchain Platform

Reach is a programming language that supports multiple blockchains, including Algorand, Ethereum, and Conflux. This allows developers to create applications that can interact with multiple blockchain networks.This makes Reach a powerful tool for building cross-chain applications.

What this means is that we can write just one contract and let Reach deal with the complexities of deploying it to multiple blockchains.
