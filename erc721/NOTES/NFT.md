## Tokens
[openzeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/tokens)
>A token contract is simply an Ethereum smart contract.
>"Sending tokens" actually means "calling a method on a smart contract that someone wrote and deployed".
>A token contract is not much more than a **mapping** of *addresses* to *balances*, plus some methods to **add** and **subtract** from those *balances*.
>Someone "has tokens" when their balance in the token contract is non-zero.
>balances could be considered:
- Money.
- Experience points in a game.
- Deeds of ownership.
- Voting rights.
